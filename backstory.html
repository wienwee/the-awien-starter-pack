    <p class="body">I was born with the sound of waves in my ears at <a href="https://hsnzkt.moh.gov.my/index.php/en/" title="HSNZKT" class="interest-link"> Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah</a>. In Kuala Terengganu, the ocean is so close you can actually see the turqoise water roght from the hospital ward window! Even though I grew up here, the beauty of Terengganu’s coastline never ceases to amaze me. The beach is my sanctuary, it’s where I find peace, and it holds a collection of my most cherished memories.<br>Being a proud <q>Terengganurian</q>, I truly believe we have the best of bothe worlds, first, stunning views and the undisputed champion of snacks, Kerepok Lekor! I've tried versions from other states, nahh, nothing can compares to the authetic taste of Terengganu!<br>One of my favourite things is a morning brisk walk through the city. Whether it's hiking up the hill in Chendering for a panoramic sea view or a relaxed stroll along <abbr title="Takir Beach">Miami Beach</abbr> with the Drawbridge glowing in the distance, it's pure bliss. Some of my sweetest memories are doing these walks with my mom, enjoying the breeze and the view together. </p>

    <p class="body">My roots are a beautiful mix where my mom is Thai and my dad is Sarawakian but if you ask me where I'm from, I will always say Terengganu with pride. One thing I definitely inherited from my mom is her deep-seated passion for music. While she's a huge fan of artists like Bruno Mars, Sheila On 7 and BTS, my own playlist spans a completely different range of genres.<br>As the eldest child, I'm the self-appointed the Godzilla. Being the big sister mean I'm the one guiding, teaching, and looking out for my siblings. I’m always making sure they manage their time well and, most importantly, reminding them to prioritize family above all else.<br>Our most cherished tradition happens every Eid al-Adha, when we travel to Narathiwat to visit my great-grandmother. In my experience, the celebrations in Thailand have a unique magic. The Thai community views Eid al-Adha as a time for deep connection—visiting every single relative, hosting grand feasts for the villagers, and performing Qurban together. It’s a beautiful reminder of where I come from.</p>

    <p class="body">Growing up, I was a huge fan of  nostalgic cartoons like <em>Wonder Pet, Upin & Ipin, Pingu and Sofia the First</em>! Those were the days! I used to be quite the sentimental kid, writing in my diary every day and listening to music on the radio. My career aspirations changed quite a bit over the years. When I was four, I was determined to be a teacher. Later, that dream evolved into becoming a scientist or an astronaut. I even chose the Science Stream in school to chase that dream, only to eventually realize those subjects weren't actually my cup of tea. Now, I’m pursuing a diploma in <mark style="color:#9e182b;">Information Management at UiTM</mark>. It’s a completely different field from my initial interests, but I still have a soft spot for science facts<sup>and Albert Einstein remains my ultimate idol!</sup><br>My early childhood was spent in Putrajaya, but we moved to Terengganu when I was five, just in time for <del>tadika</del> preschool. Transitioning was tough because I spoke standard Malay, while everyone around me spoke the local Terengganu dialect. At first, there was a real linguistic barrier and I struggled to make friends because the other kids couldn't understand me! However, I was determined to fit in. I decided to learn the dialect, and thanks to my patient friends who never got tired of my endless questions, I can now speak Terengganu slang fluently. It’s a skill I’m really proud of!</p>

    Huhu, it was a bit lonely back then...

  <p class="body">Primary school taught me some hard lessons about betrayal, but I’m happy to say I found my true tribe in secondary school. Looking back, I realized that being a 'people pleaser' and being 'too nice' can be mentally exhausting. I’ve learned that it’s much better to stay away from toxic environments. Sometimes, it’s better to have a smaller, more authentic circle<sub>or even be alone</sub>than to surround yourself with the wrong people. My circle is small now, but it’s high quality!</p>

    <p class="body">Currently, I'm living in Machang to complete my Diploma before eventually heading back home to Terengganu. Every academic break, I work alongside my step-dad; this is my primary source of income, which allows me to cover my university fees and buy things for my sister.</p>

     <p class="body">Travel is also a huge passion of mine. My dream is to make South Korea my first international destination since I’ve already learned to read Hangul and can speak a bit of the language!<sup>not too fluent</sup> I’m also obsessed with winter scenery—experiencing my first snowfall in New Zealand, Iceland, or Harbin would be an absolute dream come true.</p>
